# Advent of Code 2022
AoC is a very cool way to spend an hour a day in December hating elves.
Play yourself in a battle against the best programmer for 25 challenges, one every day.<br>
Don't worry, in theory, if it goes badly under the tree you will still find your presents.

## ⚠️Warning: 
This repository contains scratched solutions of AoC challenges.<br>
**If you haven't done the question of the day yet, reading the posted code will ruin the game experience.**
